            <p> So, you want to know how to live off the grid. It’s simple, really. Move to the woods, build a cabin, throw on some solar panels and a wind turbine for power, and drill a well. Then start raising chickens, cows, and pigs, start a garden, and sit on your front porch while sipping coffee and staring out at the beautiful natural wilderness around you. Easy, right? Not exactly.
                It takes planning, preparation, and work to move off grid. And once you’re there, the work will continue with the maintenance and upkeep of your homestead.</p>
            <p> Off-grid living can be a rewarding way to reduce your environmental impact and create a more self-sufficient lifestyle. However, it requires a lot of research and preparation to ensure that you’re adequately prepared for the challenges that come with it. By keeping these 10 basics in mind as you plan, you can start down the path toward a more sustainable and self-sufficient way of life. </p>
            <p> To the left is a great example of living off the grid. This is a shipping container home in Joshua Tree National Park. Shipping containers are the perfect building blocks for versatile and resilient sustainable homes.</p>
