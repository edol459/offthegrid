            <ul>
                <li> <b>Land </b>- Your land is the foundation of your off grid life. To go off grid, you need a parcel of land that lends itself to your new lifestyle choice. That usually means finding land in a remote area, far from strict building codes and permitting regulations.</li>
                <li> <b>Shelter </b> - Off-grid homes come in many forms: cabins, traditional wood-frame homes, tiny houses, cob houses, Earthships, strawbale homes, or even yurts, which are basically large octagonal-shaped tents. </li>
                <li> <b>Water </b>- You will most likely not have access to city water or municipal county water sources on your land, so you must choose a piece of land with a natural water source or where it’s convenient to haul water or dig a well.  </li>
                <li> <b>Food</b> - Ideally, it’s wise to have a traditional garden, some raised beds, and a greenhouse full of fruits and veggies. Meat and eggs can also be produced on your homestead if you have it set up for livestock. </li>
                <li> <b>Power Generation</b> - Granted, you most likely will not be using all your devices and appliances at once all day long, but this will help you figure out how much power in wattage you will need to generate, which will help you design your solar power system. </li>
                <li> <b>Power Storage</b> -  If you have the money, a good battery power storage system is worth its weight in gold. </li>
                <li> <b>Heating and Cooling</b> - Using natural methods like shading, insulation, ventilation, and optimal window placement can reduce your reliance on energy-intensive heating and cooling systems. Earthships are masterfully designed to utilize both passive heating and cooling.  </li>
                <li> <b>Waste Disposal</b> - Composting toilets are highly efficient and a great option for tiny houses. A septic tank system is a more permanent and robust off grid wastewater management option that can last for years with little maintenance. Septic systems are widely-used in rural areas and are often the best way to deal with wastewater.  </li>
                <li> <b>Communication & Security</b> - When living off the grid, it’s essential to have a reliable communication system in place. If you don’t have decent cell service on your property, consider keeping other devices on hand. Some of the best options are a satellite phone or even a landline. This ensures that you can stay in touch with others in case of an emergency or if you need assistance. 
                    Additionally, security is crucial when living off the grid. You’ll need to protect your property from intruders and wild animals, so investing in security cameras, motion sensors, and other security measures (even a good dog!) can be very beneficial. </li>
                <li> <b>Mindset & Will</b> - Living sustainably takes a solid commitment, sharp focus, and motivation. The self-sufficient lifestyle is at the heart of independence. With that independence comes responsibility, not just for your lifestyle choice but for your family and those depending on you.</li>
